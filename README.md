AoC 2022 â€“ https://adventofcode.com/2022

This year, I decided to try to solve problems in different languages every day.

To run it, in each folder, just fire `make a` or `make b` to part 1 and part 2 respectively.

## Problems:

-   day 1 - [Haskell](day_1/)
-   day 2 - [Python](day_2/)
-   day 3 - [Java](day_3/)
-   day 4 - [Kotlin](day_4/)
-   day 5 - [Nim](day_5/)
-   day 6 - [Lua](day_6/)
-   day 7 - [Julia](day_7)
-   day 8 - [JavaScript](day_8)
-   to be continue...
